            <h1>Bio, BIODIESEL</h1>
			<p></p>
			<p>We decided to make use of the purified oil by elaborating biodiesel.</p>
			<h3>Difference between diesel and biodiesel</h3>
			<p>Diesel is a carbon-based product extracted from petroleum that has a high energy density and is usually used in trucks and buses. It is a cheaper alternative to gasoline since it needs less refining. The thing about diesel is that non-renewable and releases harmful gases such as carbon and nitrogenous oxides, which are the main reason the ozone layer is getting weaker. Biodiesel on the other hand is a renewable source of energy also carbon based that is made with the plant oils or animal fat and some types of alcohol to create long chain of esters, making it fuel-functioning. It can be used in any diesel engine without the risk of damage to the engine and is more eco-friendly than regular diesel.</p>
			<h3>Materials</h3>
			<p>-100ml Methanol<br>-3.5g Potassium Hydroxide<br>-500ml Oil<br>-Funnel<br>-Tightly sealed jar<br>Thermometer</p>
			<h3>Procedure</h3>
			<p>1. Measure 500 ml of cooking oil, and heat them in a pot until it reaches 130°F.<br>2. While the oil is heating up, measure 100 ml of methanol and 3.5g of potassium hydroxide.<br>3.Add the potassium hydroxide to the methanol and mix them gently until it disolves. Then add the heated oil to the mixture.<br>4.Shake well for 5 minutes and let it rest 24 hours. <br>5. Perform the decantation procedure with the mix to separate the glicerine from the biodiesel.</p>
			<h3>Benefits</h3>
		  <p>A yield test was performed between alcohol and the biodiesel made out of methanol and potassium hydroxide. With an alcohol burner below a beaker full of tap water, we lighted up the burner and measured the temperature reached in the water as well as the remaining substance in the burner.</p>
		  <img src="biodiesel_graph.png" width="639.1" height="364.7">
		  <p>In the end, the temperatured reached by the alcohol was 10 degrees higher than the biodiesel. However, the amount of alcohol used was 11 ml while the amount of biodiesel was 7 ml. This means that even if the biodiesel wasn't as conductive as the alcohol, it lasts longer and a lot of it is saved.</p>
